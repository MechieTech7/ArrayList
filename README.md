# ArrayList
Java ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements. It is like an array, but there is no size limit. We can add or remove elements anytime. So, it is much more flexible than the traditional array. It is found in the java.util package. It is like the Vector in C++.

The ArrayList in Java can have the duplicate elements also.

The important points about Java ArrayList class are:

Java ArrayList class can contain duplicate elements.
Java ArrayList class maintains insertion order.
Java ArrayList class is non synchronized.
Java ArrayList allows random access because array works at the index basis.
In ArrayList, manipulation is little bit slower than the LinkedList in Java because a lot of shifting needs to occur if any element is removed from the array list.
